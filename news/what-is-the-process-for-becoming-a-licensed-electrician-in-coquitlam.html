You'll also need to attend technical training classes at a recognized institution to further your knowledge and skills in the field.</p><br />
<p>After completing all necessary training and logging the required hours, you'll be eligible to write the Red Seal exam, which is a national certification exam for electricians in Canada. Passing this exam will grant you your certification as a licensed electrician in Coquitlam.</p><br />
